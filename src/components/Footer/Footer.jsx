        I’m a Software Engineer living in Manchester.

        React Gameplay is one of my pet projects, born out of pure passion and curiosity.
        After building a few simple games in React I thought “Wouldn&apos;t it be great if
        I could share these in a way that was useful for other developers as a fun way to
        learn”. That&apos;s when React Gameplay was conceived; showcasing React&apos;s
        capabilities and serving as a learning platform for other curious developers.{' '}
        <br />I hope you enjoy it and find something useful or inspiring within these
        simple lines of code.
      </p>
    </>
