          The goal of Mastermind is to guess the secret code, a sequence of 4
          colored pegs, before you run out of turns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each turn, place your guess by choosing a color for each peg in the
          row. You can repeat colors.
        </li>
        <li>
          After submitting your guess look out for clue pegs:{' '}
          <strong>White</strong> means a correct color in the correct position,
          and <strong>Black</strong> means a correct color in the wrong
          position.
        </li>
        <li>
          The clues don&apos;t tell you which pegs they refer to so you&apos;ll
          need to use logic and deduction to narrow things down.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep adjusting your guesses based on the feedback until you crack the
          code or run out of tries!
        </li>
        <li>
          You&apos;ve got a limited number of turns so make each guess count.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the code is cracked or turns run out the hidden code will be
          revealed!

          a race against the clock. The faster you guess the code, the better.
